We are all seniors at UNCW, using this schweet website as our capstone project for Dr. Simmonds' CSC450 Course.
<br></br>
It took a lot more time than we thought it would, but that's sort of the nature of what we do, isn't it? We take on projects, and we plan and plan, but when it comes down to it: you just have to get your hands moving and knock it out...

Hope you guys and gals dig it. It was fun to make. Well, sorta fun.
<br></br>
Stay classy, everybody!
